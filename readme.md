Task Description:

Create a fully functional Income Expense Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project should allow the users to add, edit, and delete income and expense entries, providing an overview of their financial status. The project will implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage the data.

Task Requirements:

* Create a clean and intuitive layout using HTML and CSS.
* Include input fields for entering income and expense details (e.g., description, amount).
* Include 3 filters [ “all”, “income”, “expense” ] to get only the needed data. (use radio buttons)
* Display a list of all entries with options to edit or delete each one.
* Show the total income, total expenses, and net balance at the top.
* Create: Allow users to add new income and expense entries.
* Read: Display the list of entries dynamically.
* Update: Enable users to edit existing entries.
* Delete: Provide functionality to remove entries from the list.
* Add local storage functionality to persist data across sessions.
* Clean, well-documented code for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* A responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
* A brief README file explaining the project.

Code Structure:
The code is structured into several functions, each serving a specific purpose:

* updateLocalStorage: Saves the current entries to local storage.
* renderEntries: Displays the entries based on the selected filter (all, income, or expense).
* calculateTotals: Computes and updates the total income, total expenses, and net balance.
* addEntry: Adds a new entry based on user input.
* editEntry: Prepares an entry for editing by populating the input fields.
